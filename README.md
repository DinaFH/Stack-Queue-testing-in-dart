Simple dart app consists of 3 files :

1- queue file contains Queue class which implements basic operations done on queue[enqueue(),dequeue(),peek(),queueLength(),isEmpty(),isertFrontQueue(),printQueue()].

2- stack file contains Stack class which implements basic operations done on stack[push(),pop(),peek(),stackLength(),isEmpty(),printStack()]

3- main file contains tests on operations of these two data structures.
